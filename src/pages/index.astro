      Coding is challenging, but it doesn't have to be so isolating. When you work in tech, you're often surrounded by men
      or part of a tiny minority of women developers. When you're the only woman in the room, it's easy to feel alone, and
      like you don't belong. Coder Woman Academy and Community is here to help. Our mission is to help women thrive in the
      coding world, and our community is open to anyone who wants to learn from anywhere.
