## Introduction

As a kid growing up in the '90s, my gaming adventure began with NES, transitioned to Amiga 500, and later, the PC. But I was not a typical gamer. I was the kid who **read about games just as much as, if not more than, I played them**.

## Childhood Gaming Experiences

Growing up, I got my hands on **NES, Amiga 500, and PC games** that spanned from action-packed adventures to brain-teasing puzzles.

I still vividly remember those long days sitting on the carpet in my home, completely absorbed in my Pegasus console. This NES imitation was a big hit in Poland.

Super Mario Bros, Contra, Tetris, Mortal Combat, Chip'n'Dale - I loved them all! Later, I became fond of adventure games on my PC: Beyond Good and Evil, The Longest Journey, and Syberia were my favorites.

## Falling for CD-Action

The real game-changer in my life was **the Polish magazine CD-Action**. Discovering it as a kid, I was instantly hooked.

It was like a monthly Christmas presentâ€”rich with game reviews, walkthroughs, and sneak peeks into upcoming releases. Every page was an invitation to an adventure I could hardly resist.

## The Writers behind the Magic

What made CD-Action so appealing to me wasn't just the gaming content but also **the writers behind it.**

They had a unique way of engaging with their readers, sprinkling humor and showcasing a deep understanding of games. Eld, Mac Abra, Hut, EGM - they're my heroes.

One section that stood out was **"Action Redaction"** - where people wrote letters to the editorial team. The responses were hilarious and often better than comedy series on TV!

I was a huge fan of Smuggler, whose writing style was both captivating and funny. Interestingly, **I read this magazine from cover to cover.** It didn't matter what game they described - I read about them all.

That's how I became familiar with the graphics, engines, mechanics, and feelings associated with all games from that era (even multiplayer online games and FPS, which aren't my favorites).

## The Pause Button: Gaming on Hold

There came a time when I had to put my gaming passion on hold. It wasn't an easy decision, but life's priorities took precedence, and **gaming had to take a back seat.**

This phase kicked in when I was a student. Later, I got so caught up in life that I almost forgot about the joy of gaming.

I invested my energy into my career - **first as a volleyball player and later as a programmer**, despite my degree not being related to it! I'm a self-taught coder.

## The Best Birthday Gift: A PS5 and A Return to Gaming

Fast forward to my last birthday, and I received the **best gift from my husband - a Playstation 5 console!**

This was the spark that reignited my passion for gaming. Exploring the new world of games that the PS5 opened up was a thrilling experience. With my prolonged break, I realized I had much to catch up on.

## A Blast from the Past: Reading CD-Action Again

With my renewed interest in gaming, I revisited my old addiction - CD-Action.

I acquired some old issues and began catching up on games from 2016-2020. It felt like **reuniting with an old friend.**

## The Power of Reading in the Gaming World

Reading about games is not just about getting information; it's an entirely different kind of thrill. It gives you a deeper understanding of the game, its mechanics, and the world it is set in.

It makes you appreciate the effort that goes into creating these masterpieces. This is especially true for the games that I now have on my PS5. Reading about how they were produced and how predictions were about them is an incredible experience.

## The Big Question: Is Reading About Games More Fun than Playing?

And now comes the big question - **is reading about games more fun than playing them?** For me, the answer isn't black and white. Both have their unique charm and excitement. But there's something about reading that gives you a broader perspective, a deeper understanding, and a closer connection to the creators' minds.

Reading about games goes beyond just learning the details or strategies. **It's about diving into the game's universe before even pressing the power button.** It helps us understand the game's backstory, how it was built, and the intricate details that make it up.

**I see games as pieces of art** crafted with storytelling, visual and sound design, and interactive elements. I especially admire **independent game makers** who create captivating games even with limited resources.

**Physical magazines like CD-Action bring an extra layer of enjoyment.** The feel, smell, and sound of flipping the pages make the reading experience more special. Even with all the game information available online today, I still love reading the paper version of CD-Action. It's like a trip back to my childhood, eagerly awaiting each new issue.

**Playing games, on the other hand, gives a unique, interactive experience** full of excitement and achievement, which reading can't replicate. But they're not separate activities - **reading enhances playing, and playing sparks more interest in reading about games.**

So, for me, it's not about whether reading about games is more fun than playing them. It's about enjoying both and seeing how they enhance the overall gaming experience.

I'm interested in hearing your thoughts. How do you balance playing games and reading about them? What do you think about game creation as a form of art? I'm eager to hear from you!
